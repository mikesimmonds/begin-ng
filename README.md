# Begin-ng

Todo:
- Add the search module 
- Consider using lucide open source icons as they are free and high quality
- Consider a moduel where people can create workshops, a  bit like ey tpd. its an excuse for a complex form.
- When using the observable pattern for data management - it becomes more difficult to handle HTTP errors and 'is saving' buttons in the calling component as the Observable/Behaviour subject only hold the repsonse value. Consider holding the whole http response instead so errors etc can be returned right to the component.

begin-ng is designed to tbe the foundation that you build an app on top of - it has very few feature modules but does hae everything else you need to get an app runing very quickly. In some cases you may be able to compose thefeature modules completely out of elements from bein-ng
