/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */

/*
Stylesheets that are required for the successful compilation of lazy-loaded modules
are available in the /importables directory. To save having long relative imports in
the component stylesheets, this directory is added to angular.json under
```achitect.build.options.stylePreprocessorOptions.includePaths :["src/scss/importable"]```
and are added on a per-stylesheet basis using @import "<filename>"
