Custom validators are used to validate form inputs.

Depending on the type of form used (Template or Reactive) the validator will be written differently. Validators for tempalte driven forms have much more boiulder plate as they need to be made into directives and providers created for them.

As it is almost always better to use Reactive forms, all of the validators here are only for use with Reactive Forms
